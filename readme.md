Kalah
=================
Kalah is an implementation of the classic game of Mankalah in ``go``. It includes a Minimax AI. This project was written as a way for me to explore the ``go`` programing language.

Usage
-------------
Type ``go test`` to run the included unit tests.

Benchmarks are included, which can be run with ``go test -bench=.``.

To run a kalah match, use the included ``play`` program. An easy way to do so is to type ``go run play/play.go`` from the project directory.
